[has_uuid](http://github.com/tfe/has_uuid/)
========

Provides automated [UUID](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universally_Unique_Identifier) generation for ActiveRecord objects. UUIDs are created after validations on create. Some configuration options are provided if you want to keep your UUIDs in a column other than "uuid" or if you want to use a different UUID generator (default is to generate version 4 UUIDs).

Depends on the [uuidtools gem](http://github.com/sporkmonger/uuidtools/).

Installation
------------

	script/plugin install git://github.com/tfe/has_uuid.git

Usage
-----

	class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
		has_uuid
	end
	
	class User < ActiveRecord::Base
		has_uuid :column => :token, :generator => :timestamp
	end

This was written almost completely by [norbert](http://github.com/norbert/), and I just expanded upon it. [joergbattermann](http://github.com/joergbattermann/) also contributed.


Todo
----

* It would be cool if the plugin included a migration to add the UUID column. Also: a rake task to run the migration on user-specified table(s).  A migration generator would also work and may be better-suited.
* Provide a rake task for easily assigning UUIDs to existing data.
* See [`active_record_uuid`](http://github.com/gabrielg/active_record_uuid/) for examples of the above.
